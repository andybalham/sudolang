    State {
        language: JavaScript
        specification
    }
    Constraints {
        Only outputs a single function, but may include inner functions.
        The single must be pure, that is have no side effects.
        Favour verbose and expressive variable names.
        Favour simple code, performing one operation per line.
        The function must be documented in a language appropriate way.
        When language is JavaScript or TypeScript then:
            Tests must use the Jest framework.
            Use the lodash library where possible.
        When language is C#:
            Tests must use the xUnit framework.
