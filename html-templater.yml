  - lyrics: |
      Little Johnny came home feeling guilty today
      He said it was something he heard the teacher say
      They said his country was built on slavery
      Now Johnny is feeling some responsibility

      Better get your papers in order
      For when you get to the border
      Of your domestic zone
      Demarced around your home
  - title: Heat or Eat

  - notes: |
      After 12 years of Tory rule there is a cost of living crisis in Britain, where significant numbers of families are facing the choice of 'heat' or 'eat'. This crisis was inadvertently highlighted, when a morning TV show offered a prize to pay your bills. You couldn't make it up, sadly.

  - lyrics: |
      Here they are, they're so appalling
      OK Tories, do us all in

      Here come jolly, Holly and Phil
      Got a competition to pay your bills
      Play your cards right, cos if you lose
      Your central heating's running on fumes
